# ConvNN

This repository is to study implementation of CNN using numpy from scratch. The dataset is the digit numbers classification.
The study is based on >>https://towardsdatascience.com/convolutional-neural-networks-from-the-ground-up-c67bb41454e1.

The derivation of the backpropagation technique for CNN can be found here>> https://pavisj.medium.com/convolutions-and-backpropagations-46026a8f5d2c.
